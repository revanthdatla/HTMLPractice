Introduction to Deep JS Foundations
===========================
It is common in JS eco-system to take certain things for granted and come across unexpected bugs. It is highly important
to write clean code that is easily to follow for others.

Reading the JS specification helps JS dev's better understand how it's behaviour.

[JS Specification](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/).

JS specs is the place to rely on, if what the brain is reasoning is not matching with the code. That's how bugs enter
the code.

Specs are written in an algorithmic way - which explain the sequential operation of the process.

Three pillars.

# Types
- Primitive types
- Abstract Operations
- coercion
- equality
- TypeScript, Flow, etc.

# Scope
- Nested Scope
- Hoisting
- Closure
- Modules

# Objects (Oriented)
- this
- class {}
- Prototypes
- OO vs. OLOO
