JavaScript Types
===================
# Primitive Types
The common misconception in JS is that everything is an object. In reality,
most of the objects behave like object.

The ECMAScript language types are Undefined, Null, Boolean, String, Symbol, Number and Object. These are primitive types.

## undefined

## string

## number

## boolean

## object

## symbol

## undeclared?

## null?

## function?

## array?
It's a sub-type of object.

## bigint (future) ?

In JavaScript, variables dont' have types, values do.

# `typeof` operator
`typeof` returns the type of value in a given variable.

# Bigint

# Kinds of Emptiness
undefined vs. undeclared vs. uninitialized (aka TDZ)

# `NaN` & isNaN

NaN - acronym for not a number. It's a special sentinal number which represents not a number.


# Negative Zero
Exists in IEEE 754. A negative representation of zero.

# Type Check

# Fundamental Objects
aka: built-in objects.
aka: native functions.

use new:
- Object()
- Array()
- Date()
- Function()
- Date()
- RegExp()
- Error()

Don't use new:
- String()
- Number()
- Boolean()
