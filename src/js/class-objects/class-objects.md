Mixing (UP) Class Objects
=========
JS has class-like syntax elements like `new` and `instanceof` along with new ES6 additions like `class` keyword. JS Class
is not the same as other class-oriented programing languages, it is basically abstraction JS mechanism.  

JS object mechanism does not automatically perform copy behavior when inherit or instantiating. Objects do not get copied
to other objects, they are linked together. The copy behavior of classes in JS is done through mixins: explicit and 
implicit.
