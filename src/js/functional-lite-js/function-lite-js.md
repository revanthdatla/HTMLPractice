Functional Lite Java Script
===========================

### Imperative programming

Focused primarily on how to do things.

### Declarative programming

Outcome and why

What is a function? qualified at the time. wrote a sentence. functional
programming is not all about functions.

pedagogy. procedure. A function, takes input and return output. evolves
in the further discussion.

A function, can call only function not procedure.

A function, the semantic relationship between input and computed output.


To be a function, it should not be having side effects. Indirect inputs
/ outputs are considered side effects in functional programming.

Avoid side effects with function calls, if possible.

### Side Effects

- I/O (console, files, etc)
- Database storage
- Network calls
- DOM
- Timestamps
- Random numbers
- CPU Heat
- CPU Time Delay

Intention to minimize side effects.

## Pure Functions

reduce the surface area of unexpected behaviour.
